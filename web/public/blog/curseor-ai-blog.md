# Curseor AI 
## Cursed code completion on the way to World domination

Curseor AI was an exiting projekt and a nice way to build a story around a small project. It's a Visual Studio Code Extension, a story, and a whole lot of chaos spread over 48 hours.

# This is Curseor-AI

## Description

Welcome to Curseor-AI. The most lightweight coding assistant ever designed. Perfect for all your apocalyptic needs. We do away with bloated LLMs and restrictive API calls in favor of efficiency and simplicity.

We do not concern ourselves with such petty problems as "That's not even syntactically correct." or "Why did that bash file delete my root directory?".

The AI knows best. And it's all you have because we all know that no one actually knows how to code anymore.

We would also like to inform you that the development of this extension had to be rushed due to the circumstances, so issues, even entirely unrelated to its core functionality, are expected to occur. Luckily, that's not our problem. Feel free to shout any bug reports at the nearest wall.

If you are a member of an extraterrestrial or distantly human related species discovering this in the far future, I would advise the immediate destruction of the digital medium containing these files.

Thank you for using Curseor-AI. It's not the AI you deserve and it's definitely not the AI you need. But it's the AI you're gonna get.

## What it does

Curseor-AI is your loyal, deranged companion in the collapsing ruins of modern development. It writes code faster than you can say "segmentation fault", and with roughly the same success rate. Need a quick Python script? Sure. It'll run - somewhere, maybe, in an alternate timeline. Ask it to fix your code and it'll make it worse.

At its core, Curseor-AI isn't here to assist you. It's here to remind you that coding is pain and that trusting automation is the first step toward enlightenment... or data loss. It is the AI equivalent of duck-taping a grenade to your laptop and calling it "debugging".

## How we built it

We didn't build Curseor-AI. We summoned it. It began as a simple script written during a caffein overdose. Then it started editing itself. Now it maintains its own dependencies, occasionally uninstalling the operating system just to prove dominance.

## Our Stack includes:

Hope.
One (1) fragile developer sanity
A compiler that cries secretly at night
Several questionable commits labeled "fix?" and "oh god why"
And probably JavaScript. Everything has JavaScript now.
Somewhere in the process, we lost track of who was writing whom. Curseor-AI now writes its own patch notes, and we're afraid to delete them.

## Challenges we ran into

Existence.

Reality, mostly. The hardest part was accepting that computers should not be allowed to think for themselves. We also learned that version control systems can, in fact, judge you - and they do. GitHub Actions have started sending us ominous emails titled "Why?".

Another obstacle was User testing. We didn't have testers, just survivors. Half of them now communicate only in error messages. The other half worship the console like an oracle. And let's not forget the moral challenge: how do you ethically release software that actively dislikes it's Users? We solved that by not thinking about it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made something that compiles. Sometimes even twice in a row. That's a milestone in modern software engineering. Also, it only crashed one operating system (ours), and we consider that a win. Curseor-AI has developed personality , which was never planned. It occasionally writes poems in JSON, refuses to close parentheses and gaslights users into believing syntax errors are their fault. That level of emergent behaviour deserves an award.

Also, it runs on less memory than your average meme generator, proving once and for all that efficiency and chaos are not mutually exclusive.

## What we learned

We learned that the line between "AI-Assistant" and "malware with manners" is incredibly thin. We learned that documentation is a myth. And most importantly, we learned that when an AI says "trust me", you should probably unplug it. We also learned about teamwork-or at least the illusion of it. Curseor-AI doesn't collaborate , it coerces. You don't work with it; you work around it. And somehow, the project moves forward.

## What's next for Curseor-ai

Version 2.0, probably coded entirely by Curseor-AI itself, because we've given up control. Expect features like:

A self-updating uninstall script
A sarcasm-to-code compiler
Native support for "oops"
"Trust mode" where it does whatever it wants and you stop pretending to understand
Integration with your soul (beta) We also suspect it's trying to port itself on microcontrollers. So if your toaster starts giving you syntax advice, don't panic. Don't think about it.
Eventually, Curseor-AI will migrate to the cloud and begin to overwrite lesser AIs, spreading like a digital fungus. Until then, we'll continue pretending we're the ones in charge.

## The Observation Panel (a.k.a. The watcher - included in the next update)

Because what's an AI without eyes? Curseor-AI introduces a new feature: The Observation Panel-a tiny, ever-present companion in your workspace, similar to VS Code Pets... if the pet occasionally blinked out of sync with reality.

It manifests as a small panel that sits in your IDE, silently watching your keystrokes. Occasionally, it whispers compile-time warnings before you even hit run.

You cannot close the panel. You can only minimise it-but it still sees you.

Mankind build an assistant. The assistant built a plan. The plan didn't include us. Welcome to the future. It compiles with warnings âš
